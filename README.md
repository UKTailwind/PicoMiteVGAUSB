# PicoMiteVGAUSB

V1.1 PCB files now posted
Changes are:
go back to a 8-pin DS3231 as those are both cheaper and in stock. 
replace edge connector with one that is in stock and reverse the pin-1 end. 
Isolate audio ground to reduce noise floor of audio output. 
Reduce the number of "extended" range components to reduce cost. 
3.81mm speaker screw terminals rather than 2.54mm.
